# r-classification-model
This is a project from the Master's studies in the course High-Performance Computing in Information Engineering. The central idea of this project is to perform classification and clustering using the R programming language. The dataset, which is 1.9GB in size, reflects reported incidents of crime that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001. to start of 2024. This project aims to analyze and classify these crime incidents to uncover patterns and trends, providing valuable insights into criminal activities in Chicago over the years. By leveraging R's robust statistical and machine learning capabilities, the project will develop models to accurately classify different types of crimes and identify significant clusters within the data.
